# wolfie-ball-draft
This project is a simulation fantasy baseball draft system.

I used NetBeans as IDE, and the wolfieball_Draft_Kit is useing PropertiesManager,XMLUtilities and javax.json-1.0.4.jar as dependent library.
so before you run the wolfieball_Draft_Kit, make sure that you setup the library. the order should be , PropertiesManager,XMLUtilities andjavax.json-1.0.4.jar at last.
